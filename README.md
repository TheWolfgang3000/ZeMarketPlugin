ZeMarketSystem:

Are you tired of your players' chaotic, unregulated commerce? Do you look at your server's economy and think, "This needs more soul-crushing bureaucracy and landlord-style control"? Do you believe the concept of a "free market" is something that happens on other, less organized servers? Welcome home.

ZeMarketSystem is for the server admin who sees a beautiful, open field and thinks, "I could make a fortune here by carving this up into tiny, rentable plots and enforcing strict building codes." This plugin lets you do what vanilla Minecraft is too idealistic to consider: create and manage designated market zones where players can rent shops, but only under your watchful, all-powerful gaze.

What is this Capitalist Contraption?
Forget the anarchy of players building shoddy little stalls wherever they please. ZeMarketSystem allows you to designate any massive area as an official "Market Region." Inside this glorious monument to central planning, you can then create smaller, rentable "Shop Plots." It's clean, it's orderly, and it's the most efficient way to give your players the illusion of economic freedom while ensuring you hold all the cards.

Features
God-Tier Zoning Control: Create massive, protected Market Regions where non-OP players can't even place a torch without permission. It's your world; they just live in it.

Rentable Micro-Plots: Carve up your regions into tiny shop plots. When created, they are automatically cleared and marked with a sign, ready for the next hopeful entrepreneur.

A Timed Lease on Life: Players can rent a shop for 30 days. The sign automatically updates with their name and the terrifying countdown of their remaining lease. They can renew it by clicking the sign again, prolonging the inevitable.

The Automatic Eviction Service: When a player's 30-day lease expires, our automated system ruthlessly purges their belongings from the plot, resets the area, and puts the "For Sale" sign back up. No mess, no fuss, just cold, efficient turnover.

Iron-Clad Protection: The system protects not only the regions and plots but also the signs and the very stone blocks they stand on. Because nothing is sacred, but property lines are.

Simple (ish) Commands: A handful of commands is all that separates you from becoming a real estate tycoon. We even included a /yes and /no system so players feel like they have a choice.

How to Become a Real Estate Mogul (A User Guide)
Establishing your economic empire is a multi-step process that asserts your dominance at every stage.

Define Your Territory. First, you must create a Market Region. Go to one corner and type /market region pos1. Then, go to the opposite corner and type /market region pos2. You have now claimed this land.

Give It a Bureaucratic Name. Type /market region create <region_name>. Call it something intimidating like Trade_District_Alpha.

Create the Tenements. Now, go inside your new region. Find a spot for a small shop. Type /market shop pos1 at one corner and /market shop pos2 at the other.

Finalize the Plot. Type /market shop create. The plugin will instantly flatten the area and place a sign on a stone block, a silent testament to your power. The plot is now ready to generate revenue.

Watch the Peasants Toil. Players can now walk up to the sign, right-click it, and type /yes to begin their 30-day journey of commerce. They are limited to one shop, because we're not monsters.

The Sacred Texts (Commands)
Permission: All commands require OP status. Because letting players manage their own market would defeat the entire purpose.

Command	Description

/market region pos1	Sets the first corner of your massive, overarching market region.

/market region pos2	Sets the second corner.

/market region create <name>	Finalizes the region and gives it a name.

/market region delete <name>	Erases the region and, satisfyingly, all shops within it.

/market shop pos1	Sets the first corner of a tiny, rentable plot inside a region.

/market shop pos2	Sets the second corner of that plot.

/market shop create	Clears the plot and makes it available for rent.

/market shop delete	Deletes the specific shop plot you are currently standing in.

/market help	Reminds you of all the powerful commands at your disposal.

The commands /yes and /no are available to all players when prompted to rent a shop.

Installation (The Boring But Necessary Part)

Download the latest ZeMarketSystem.jar from the Releases page.

Place the .jar file into your server's /plugins directory.

Restart your server.

If your server doesn't burst into flames, you've likely succeeded. The plugin will generate marketregions.yml and marketshops.yml to meticulously track every detail of your economic empire.

Use the commands above to configure your automated market empire. If it works, you did it right. If not, you probably missed step 1.
